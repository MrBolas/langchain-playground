# Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound spaghetti
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- 8 oz pancetta or bacon, diced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Olive oil

## Instructions:

1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions until it is al dente. Drain the pasta and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and Pecorino Romano cheese. Set aside.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and cook the pancetta or bacon for 5-7 minutes until crispy.
4. Add the garlic to the skillet and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
5. Remove the skillet from heat and add the cooked pasta, tossing it with the pancetta and garlic.
6. Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, quickly tossing it to combine and avoid scrambling the eggs. The residual heat from the pasta and skillet will cook the eggs gently.
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, garnished with additional Pecorino Romano cheese if desired. Enjoy!
