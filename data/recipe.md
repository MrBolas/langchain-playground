# Pizza Dough Recipe

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups of warm water
* 2 teaspoons of active dry yeast
* 3 tablespoons of olive oil
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 4 cups of all-purpose flour

**Instructions:**

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the yeast 
is activated and foamy.
2. Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour, one cup at a time, until the dough becomes smooth and 
elastic. You may not need all of the remaining flour, so adjust accordingly.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and 
elastic.
5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place 
for 1-2 hours until it has doubled in size.
6. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
7. Punch down the dough and divide it into as many portions as you want to make individual pizzas.
8. Roll out each portion of dough into a thin circle, about 1/4 inch thick.
9. Place the dough on a baking sheet or pizza stone that has been sprinkled with cornmeal.
10. Top the dough with your desired toppings and bake for 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden brown 
and the toppings are cooked through.

Enjoy your homemade pizza!
